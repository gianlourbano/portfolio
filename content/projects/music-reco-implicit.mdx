# Music Recommendation with Implicit Feedback

Matrix factorization on user–item play counts with confidence weighting.

## Approach

-   Build sparse COO from play counts
-   Weighted-ALS (Hu–Koren–Volinsky)
-   Serve with ANN index (HNSW)

```python
# pseudo: build COO
i, j, v = plays.user_id, plays.track_id, plays.count
R = coo_matrix((v, (i, j)), shape=(n_users, n_items))
```
